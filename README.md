#Delayed Start Circuit
Output low for about 2.4 seconds after button input. Then output goes high for remainder of button input. Time delay can be modified by changing C1/R1 - Time = 1.1 X R1 X C1 = 1.1 X 10k X 220uF = 2.42s


#Oneshot Burst Circuit
Output high for about 2.4 seconds right when the button is initially pressed. Then output goes low for remainder of button input. Time delay can be modified by changing C1/R1 - Time = 1.1 X R1 X C1 = 1.1 X 10k X 220uF = 2.42s
